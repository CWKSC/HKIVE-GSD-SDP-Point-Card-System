In addition, there is a related report : [Report.pdf](https://github.com/CWKSC/HKIVE-GSD-SDP-Point-Card-System/blob/master/Report.pdf)

this report was written midway and there are many mistakes. You can try to learn more through it.

This is just a student's work that contains a lot of bug behind it.

The UI design reference to:
